### 🚀 Major Features
- **Database-First Architecture**: Complete elimination of file dependencies for pure database-to-AFIP workflow
- **Enhanced Binance Integration**: Direct API-to-database storage with intelligent order tracking

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Database Override Bug**: Orders marked as failed now properly retry instead of being skipped as duplicates
- **Fixed Invoice Date Formatting**: Resolved "NaNNaNNaN" date issue that was causing 400 errors in AFIP requests

- **Zero File Dependencies**: Eliminated JSON/CSV intermediate files for 50% faster processing
- **Real-time Status Updates**: ACID-compliant database transactions with instant status tracking
